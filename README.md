# Catalan Numbers
When counting the number of ways a hiker can move from point A to point B given that he can
only move North and East or the number of ways a set of operators can be arranged back into an
equation, the answer often lies in combinatorial mathematics. Catalan numbers, a sequence of
natural numbers that counts various combinatorial structures, provides solutions to problems like
this. 

The focus of this research is in twofold: to explore the recursive nature of Catalan numbers
and to analyze their representation through generating functions. By investigating these, we gain
insight into how Catalan numbers emerge in diverse combinatorial structures.
Key structures examined in this study include valid parenthesization, the triangulation of convex
polygons, and Dyck paths, each of which demonstrates a natural correspondence with Catalan
numbers. 

Through a detailed analysis of these structures, the recursive properties of Catalan
numbers are illustrated, alongside their combinatorial interpretations. Generating functions are
employed to provide effcient means of deriving these numbers, offering a deeper understanding
of their underlying patterns and relationships.

The results presented in this project underscore the usefulness of Catalan numbers in solving
a wide range of mathematical problems, from counting parenthesis to evaluating Dyck paths.
By highlighting their theoretical signifcance, this research contributes to a more comprehensive
understanding of Catalan numbers and their role in combinatorial mathematics.
